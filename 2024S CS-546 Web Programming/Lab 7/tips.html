                    <h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>
                    <p>Whether you're in the streets of Ravnica or the jungles of Ixalan, staying hydrated is very important.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Keep Extra Rations With You</h3>
                    <p>It is always useful to keep extra rations with you. You never know when you won't be able to find food.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Learn to Forage and Hunt</h3>
                    <p>You cannot keep an indefinite amount of food and water with you, so make sure you know how to forage and hunt.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Stay Armed</h3>
                    <p>You never know when you could be attacked by a vampire. Or a zombie. Or a demon.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Stay Alert</h3>
                    <p>Trust your gut. If something seems dangerous, that's probably because it is.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Avoid Vampires</h3>
                    <p>Never ask a vampire of Ixalan about his religion unless you want to become immortal against your will. (Believe me, being immortal isn't as cool as it sounds.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Never Buy Anything From a Demon</h3>
                    <p>I honestly wouldn't mind buying from them, but I wish I could just pay with money, rather than my soul. Y'know, like EVERY OTHER BUSINESS.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Never Borrow Money From the Orzhov Syndicate</h3>
                    <p>They'll make sure you can't pay it back, so that when you die, they own your soul.</p>
