            <h2>Ixalan</h2>
            <p> I had an incredible time in Ixalan! I got to sail on a pirate ship, ride dinosaurs, and even explored the Lost City of Quetzatl! I did get bit by a vampire in the process, and even though it hurt a lot, I am now immortal, so that's cool, I guess. </p>

            <p>There are certainly parts of Ixalan I'd avoid, however. There are a bunch of weird river people that patrol the waters, so I would stay away from the rivers unless absolutely necessary. Also, stay away from the Legion of Dusk. That's how I got bit. Unless you want to get bit, in 
            which case, go for it? I guess? Anyway, here's a list of places to visit (and not visit): </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Quetzatl: Amazing!! A must-see!</li>
                <li>Dragonskull Summit: The pirates here are a lot of fun, but they can be a little rowdy.</li>
                <li>Cinder Barrens: This place is cool, but it kinda gave me the creeps.</li>
                <li>Legion's Landing: This is where I got bit, so beware.</li>
                <li>Hidden Volcano: TOO HOT!!!</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Kaldheim</h2>
            <p>After sailing around Ixalan a bit, I decided to heard North to Kaldheim. The first person to greet me when I arrived in Kaldheim was a warrior with an axe who mistook me for what he called a "Draugr" and tried to kill me. Apparently, Draugr are undead warriors and I looked like one 
            due to my ghostly vampiric visage. Anyway, he introduced me to his "clan", which was called the "Skelle Clan." After breakfast, they invited me to participate in a raid against a rival clan. Of course, I had absolutely no interest in getting involved in some barbaric clan rivalry,
            so I told them I wanted to sit this one out. They began to yell at me and call me a coward, which wasn't very nice, so I left and went into the woods.</p>

            <p>Once I went into the woods, I met some nice elves. Not like Keebler elves, but more like Tolkien elves. Anyway, they welcomed me and showed me their giant fortress carved out of interconnected trees. It was really cool! I didn't want to overstay my welcome, so I thanked them and 
                then left in the morning after breakfast. I then went to a bunch of other places in Kaldheim, such as the Dwarven Forges, and Starnheim, where I met a bunch of cool warrior women with wings called Valkyrie. It started out rough, but was a really nice trip. Here's a list of places
                to visit (or not):
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Starnheim: Absolutely beautiful! And the Valkyrie are lovely!</li>
                <li>Elven Fortress: Incredible! Come here right after Starnheim!</li>
                <li>Dwarven Forges: Interesting, but kinda hot and stuffy.</li>
                <li>Planes of War: This is where the clans go to fight. Not for the feint of heart.</li>
                <li>The Frozen North: Just don't. It's cold and everything here is either dead or undead.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Ravnica</h2>
            <p>After leaving Kaldheim, I decided to head to the city of Ravnica. Now, when I say that this city is big, I mean it is BIG! I arrived at the city on an air ship, and as I was coming down, the only thing I could see from so high up was the city itself. It was breathtaking!</p>

            <p>One important thing to remember in Ravnica is that the guilds are in charge. If a police officer from the Azorius Senate asks you to do something, you do it. However, if a member of the Orzhov Syndicate asks if you want to borrow money, you should immediately start speaking gibberish
            and walk away. The Orzhov are in the tradition of allowing you to borrow money that you won't be able to pay back, and then they own your soul when you die. To be fair, I'm kinda immortal because I got bit by a vampire, but it probably wasn't a good idea to borrow it nevertheless. Anwyay, 
            here's a list of places in Ravnica to visit or not visit:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Itu-Ghazi: Undoubtedly the largest tree I have ever seen.</li>
                <li>Niv-Mizzet: The engineers here are really cool!</li>
                <li>Rakdos Club: This place is fun, but you can only party for so long.</li>
                <li>Azorius Senate: It's just a government building, so not that interesting.</li>
                <li>Church of Orzhov: They literally took my money and did nothing for me.</li>
            </ol>
