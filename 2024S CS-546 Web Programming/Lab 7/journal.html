                <h2>Pirates in Ixalan</h2>
                <cite>March 18, 2024</cite>
                <p>Today, I met a pirate named Blackbeard at the pirate stronghold at Dragonskull Summit. Crazy guy. He likes to light the edge of his beard on fire with black powder. The other pirates were a lot of fun, but became pretty rowdy by nightfall, so I couldn't get much sleep.</p>

                <h2>Raid on Quetzatl</h2>
                <cite>March 19, 2024</cite>
                <p>After blasting some vampires with our cannons, we decided to visit the Lost City of Quetzatl. This place was amazing! They had a fountain that didn't run out of water!</p> 
                <p>When we tried to return to the ship, we got attacked by these weird river people who didn't like us using their river. We made it back to the ship ok, though.</p>

                <h2>Hidden Volcano</h2>
                <cite>March 20, 2024</cite>
                <p>We then traveled on dinosaur-back (yes, dinosaur-back) to a hidden volcano in the area. The jungle was already hot enough, but this place was SWELTERING. I did not like it at all, and was happy to leave it.</p>
                <p>On our way back to Dragonskull Summit, we traveled through a pirate ship graveyard called the Cinder Barrens. Seeing the husks of the old ships was cool, but this place kinda gave me the creeps.</p>

                <h2>Legion's Landing</h2>
                <cite>March 21, 2024</cite>
                <p>I decided to visit the vampire fortress at Legion's Landing ask some of the vampires here about their relgion. Rather than explain it to me, they bit me instead! The nerve! They then told me that they did me a "favor," and that I would now be immortal.</p>
                <p>Look, being immortal is pretty cool, but they could have asked first! I think I'm going to leave Ixalan.</p>

                <h2>Welcome to Kaldheim!</h2>
                <cite>April 8, 2024</cite>
                <p>I arrived in Kaldheim today only to be greeted by a guy with an axe trying to chop my head off! Apparently, due to my ghostly vampiric visage, he mistook me for some undead warrior called a "Draugr."</p>
                <p>After realizing that I was not a Draugr, he invited me to join his clan, called the "Skelle" clan. I agreed, and joined him at their longhouse. They gave me dinner, and sang songs. They certainly are a rowdy bunch!</p>

                <h2>Elven Woods</h2>
                <cite>April 9, 2024</cite>
                <p>I woke and had breakfast in their longhouse, only for them to tell me that they were going to go to battle with some other clan. I told them I had no interest, and they started cursing at me, calling me craven and a coward! Needless to say, I took exception to the idea, and left.</p>
                <p>I wandered South and entered some woods run by some elves. (The tall kind, not santa's elves.) Their forest was like a fortress carved from interlinked trees. It's amazing!</p>

                <h2>Dwarven Forges</h2>
                <cite>April 10, 2024</cite>
                <p>I didn't want to overstay my welcome with the elves, so I decided to leave shortly after morning. I headed North, toward a mountain run by dwarves.</p>
                <p>They invited me inside the mountain and showed me their forge. It was cool, but it was also kinda stuffy and hot. Also, the ceilings are lower than I would like, and everything is made out of stone here. And I mean EVERYTHING, even the beds!</p>

                <h2>Frozen North</h2>
                <cite>April 11, 2024</cite>
                <p>After leaving the forges, I decided to sleep on the cot on a ship as it was headed North toward the frozen lands. Seeing the Aurora Borealis was cool, but this place is the WORST!</p>
                <p>It is freezing here! I mean just completely overly cold, to the point that it's not even fun anymore. Also, other than the crew of my ship, the only people I have met here have been either dead, or undead. Also, this is where those "draugr" come from, apparently.</p>

                <h2>Starnheim</h2>
                <cite>April 12, 2024</cite>
                <p>I left he Frozen North as quickly as I got there and instead decided to visit the Temple of Starnheim in the East. While there, I met some beautiful winged warrior women called the Valkyrie. I would have asked one to marry me then and there, but then I realized that'd probably be
                    rude and they'd want to kill me.</p>
                <p>They invited me into the temple where I had dinner with them, and we sang some angelic songs. This part alone made the trip to Kaldheim worth it!</p>

                <h2>Welcome to Ravnica!</h2>
                <cite>May 30, 2024</cite>
                <p>Seeing as I wasn't likely to find anything better than Starheim while in Kaldheim, I decided to visit the great City of Ravnica! I traveled via airship to the largest city I had ever seen. Even as I was descending, I could not find where the city stopped and the country began.</p>
                <p>As I was entering into the city, I had to head through the Azorius Senate building, where some future-prediction mages determined whether or not I would commit a crime while in the city. They determined that I would not (of course) and allowed me into the city. While the sign 
                    in front of the building was pretty impressive, nothing else about this building is very interesting. After finding the hotel, I decided to hit the local night club, called the Rakdos Club. While the party was pretty fun at first, you can only party for so long before it gets
                    boring. That, and some demons attempted to sell me something, so I decided it was time for me to leave.</p>

                <h2>Itu-Ghazi</h2>
                <cite>May 31, 2024</cite>
                <p>I woke up the following morning with a headache, and decided to see a doctor for some pain relief. The guy tried to offer replacing my arms with crab arms, so I left and instead went to visit the nature center, where I thought a walk outside could do me some good. While there,
                    I saw the largest tree I had ever seen. The elves there called it the Itu-Ghazi. I don't know what it means, but it sounded cool.</p>
                <p>Later that day, once my headache cleared, I decided to visit Niv-Mizzet, the home of the engineers. This place was amazing! There were so many inventions! Though I did find it strange when I asked the inventors what the machines were suppposed to do, and they responded by 
                    saying they were still trying to figure that out.</p>

                <h2>Church of Orzhov</h2>
                <cite>June 1, 2024</cite>
                <p>The following day, I woke up to visit the local market just outside of the Azorius Senate. While there, I was approached by a man offering to let me borrow some money. I turned him down, as I do not borrow money. He then invited me to church. Looking to take in the local culture,
                    I agreed to go. While there, I gave them a free will offering to support their mission, and then they proceeded to do literally nothing but kick me out. It may have been because I was a vampire, but who knows?</p>
                <p>Well, Ravnica was fun, but I think I want to leave for somewhere else. Maybe Tarkhir?</p>
