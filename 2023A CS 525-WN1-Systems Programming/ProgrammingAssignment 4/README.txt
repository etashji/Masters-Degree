Explanation:

The program begins by asking the user for the directory that files are to be backed up from.

If that directory doesn't exist, the program will return an error message.

The program will then ask the user for the directory that files are to be backed up to.

If that directory doesn't exit, the progrm will returnh an error message.

The program will then begin to iterate through the directory where files are being backed up from.

If the file is a directory, the program will ignore it.

Otherwise, it will then determine if the file being backed up from already exists in the directory where content is being copied to.

If so, it will then check to see if the file has been updated since the last backup.

If so, it will ignor the file. Otherwise, it will copy all the contents from the file being backed up into the file that content is being backed up to.

If the file does not exist, the program will create a new file in the directory where content is being backed up to. This file will have the same name as the original file. 

It will then copy the contents of the original file into the backup file.

Once it is done iterating through the directory, the program will close as all the files will be backed up.
